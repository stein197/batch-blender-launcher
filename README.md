# Batch for Blender Launcher
This script runs and opens `.blend` files with the latest stable installed Blender version downloaded with [Blender Launcher](https://github.com/DotBow/Blender-Launcher).

## Installing
Place [`blender.bat`](blender.bat) in the folder where the launcher downloads Blender. The directory should look roughly like this:

```
Blender/
╠═ .temp/
╠═ custom/
╠═ daily/
╠═ experimental/
╠═ stable/
╠═ template/
╠═ blender.bat
╚═ blender.ico
```

And associate all `.blend` files with this script so the can be opened with it. Optionally associate those files with `blender.ico` icon.
